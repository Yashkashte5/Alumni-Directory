1.1 Problem Definition:
An alumni of a college, university, or other school is a former student who has either attended or graduated in some course from the institution. Educational Institutions are always eager to know their graduates after they pass out. Alumni directory helps getting information of their alumni. Alumni committee needs to send google form link to alumni and then manual entry of data is done. So, in our system , alumni will just register themselves and their data will be stored in MySQL database. Alumni committee or admin have the rights to update details or delete unrecognisable alumni . 

1.2 Initial Investigation:
We started to investigate about alumni directory of our college. We first understood the problems. Then we analysed the problems that were faced by institution by reviewing them. After reviewing the exact process of old alumni directory, we got problems mentioned below
•	In existing system , alumni committee needs to send google form link to alumni and then manual entry of data is done.
•	Alumni committee search all the records of alumni manually.
•	Existing system cannot display alumni data according to their details. 
We found out that PHP is the suitable language for our project. Then we discussed with our mentor to confirm that we would perform database connectivity with MySQL server using Xampp.

1.3 Scope of the project:
Project scope is the part of project planning that involves determining and documenting a list of specific project goals, deliverables, features, functions, tasks, deadlines, and ultimately costs. In other words, it is what needs to be achieved and the work that must be done to deliver a project. Alumni directory acts as an interactive medium between the alumni and the School, College, University or institution. At the same time, it helps the alumni to communicate with the institution, may be a school, or college or a university and with the old batch mates. Educational institution needs to keep track of their passed-out students. So, Alumni directory helps them to keep record of each and every alumni. Alumni directory helps institution to maintain connectivity between alumni and institution.  Educational institution's alumni are the single greatest symbol of the success of institution. An alumni directory helps you ensure that you never lose access to them and continue to engage with them long after they have graduated. 

1.4. Solution:
Alumni will register themselves in our system. Their complete details will be stored in MySQL database. After successfully getting registered alumni will able to see his details and any events conducting in institution. Alumni will able to see their batchmates in system. Alumni can easily search all the details of alumni using search filters. Alumni committee or admin have the rights to update details or delete unrecognisable alumni .
